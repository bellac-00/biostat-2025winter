## Reproducible research in statistics/data science

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication is **not** the scholarship itself, it is merely **advertising** of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.
>
> [Buckheit and Donoho (1995)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-2544-7_5)

## Non-reproducible research

## Why reproducible research

- Reproducibility has been the foundation of science. It helps accumulate scientific knowledge.

- Greater research impact.

- Better work habit boosts quality of research.

- Better teamwork. For **you** as graduate students, it means better communication with your advisor.
```{r}
#| eval: false
while true
  Student: "that idea you told me to try - it doesn't work!"  
  Professor: "ok. how about trying this instead."
end
```
Unless you reproduce the computing environment (algorithms, dataset, tuning parameters), others cannot help you.

## How to be reproducible in data science?

> When we publish articles containing figures which were generated by computer, we also publish the complete software environment which generates the figures.

> [Buckheit and Donoho (1995)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-2544-7_5)

- I highly recommend the book _Reproducible Research with R and RStudio_ by Christopher Gandrud. In HW1, you are going to reproduce the whole book.

    - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book)

## Tools for reproducible research

- Version control: Git+GitHub.

- Distribute method implementation, e.g., R/Python/Julia packages, on GitHub or bitbucket.

- Dynamic document: RMarkdown for R, [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) for Julia/Python/R, Quarto.

- Docker container for reproducing a computing environment.

- Cloud computing tools.

We are going to practice reproducible research **now**. That is to make your homework reproducible using Git, GitHub, and Quarto/RMarkdown.
