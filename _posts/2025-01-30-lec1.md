## Announcements

* [HW2](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2025winter/hw/hw2/hw2.html) due Friday Feb 7 @ 11:59pm.

* Feedback on HW1 (thanks to Tomoki):

    * Did not submit hw (2).  
    
    * Did not submit pdf file (6).  
    
    * Reproducibility. Can TA reproduce your results by clicking Render?    
    
    * Absolute path vs relative path. Absolute path `/Users/username/filename` is not reproducible.
    
    * What files to include in Git? No `.DS_Store` or `pg42671.txt`. Use `.gitignore` smartly.  
    
    * Time command to compare compressed and decompressed files.  
    
    * 80 character rule.
