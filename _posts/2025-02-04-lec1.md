## Today

* Data transformation (cont'd, combine cases).

* Data visualization by ggplot2.

## Announcements

* [HW2](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2025winter/hw/hw2/hw2.html) due this Friday Feb 7 @ 11:59pm.

## Q&A

* Q: In HW2 Q2.5, Q2.6, and Q3, the first 10 rows change each time I run the code. Is that normal?

    A: See Tomoki's comment on Slack. Due to parallel processing, the order of rows may change. Use `arrange(subject_id, charttime, itemid)` to sort the rows for consistent output.
