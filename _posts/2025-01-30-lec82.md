## Announcements

* [HW2](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2025winter/hw/hw2/hw2.html) due Friday Feb 7 @ 11:59pm.

* [MDSH Mid-Course Assessment Survey](https://forms.office.com/r/0FXL4S23xF).

* Feedback on HW1 (thanks to Bowen and Parsa):

    * Did not submit hw (6).  
    
    * Did not submit pdf file (6).  
    
    * Reproducibility. Can TA reproduce your results by clicking Render?    
    
    * Absolute path vs relative path. Absolute path `/Users/username/filename` is not reproducible.
    
    * What files to include in Git? No `.DS_Store` or `pg42671.txt`. Use `.gitignore` smartly.  
    
    * Time command to compare compressed and decompressed files.  
    
    * 80 character rule.  

## Q&A

* Q: I want a chat bot in RStudio. 

    A: Install `chattr` package. Then you can `Send prompt` and `Open Chat` from the `Addins` menu.
    
* Q: My computer is old and slow. Can I survive this class? 

    A: If your computer has <16GB RAM and/or insufficient hard disk space, please inform TA and me. I will not ask you to buy a new computer for this class.
