## Today

* Linux basics (cont'd from awk).

* Reproducible research.

* Git/GitHub.

* Lab 3 (Docker).

## Q&A

* Q: Copilot not working on qmd files in RStudio.

A: Known [issue](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/15539) for RStudio 2024.12.0+467. Workaround: download and install a newer version of RStudio, e.g., at [Daily Builds](https://dailies.rstudio.com/rstudio/kousa-dogwood/).
