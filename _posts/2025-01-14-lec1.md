## Today

* Lab 2 (cont'd from Q2).

* Linux basics.

* Lab 3 (Docker).

## Announcements

* Everyone should be in the Slack channel `biostat-203b-2025-winter-lec1` by now.   

* PhysioNet credentialing process may take long. After successful credentialing, you can DM TA or me on Slack so we can add you to a UCLA Box folder where you can download the MIMIC data set. In my experience, downloading from the PhysioNet website is very slow, taking 4-5 hours.

## Zoom etiquettes

- Full name, plus other necessary information (affiliation, pronouns).

- Mute yourself when not speaking.

- Turn on your camera if possible.
