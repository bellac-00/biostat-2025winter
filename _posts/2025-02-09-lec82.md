## Today

* Data transformation (cont'd, combine variables).

* Data visualization by ggplot2.

* An example from MIMIC IV.

## Announcements

* [HW3](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2025winter/hw/hw3/hw3.html) due Friday Feb 21 @ 11:59pm. **Start early**.

## Q&A

* Q: Given `flights_sml <- select(flights, year:day, ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time)`, what is the difference between `flights_sml |> group_by(year, month, day) |> filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) < 10)` and `flights_sml |> group_by(year, month, day) |> slice_max(arr_delay, n = 9)`?

    A: TODO.
