## Today

* Linux basics (cont'd from `awk`).

* Reproducible research.

* Git/GitHub.

* Lab 3 (Docker).

## Q&A

* PhysioNet credentialing process may take long. After successful credentialing, you can DM TA or me on Slack so we can add you to a UCLA Box folder where you can download the MIMIC data set. In my experience, downloading from the PhysioNet website is very slow, taking 4-5 hours.

* Windows WSL user, make sure use the [instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-server/) for your specific Ubuntu version.

* GitHub Student Developer Pack application rejected due to not in LA. Anyone knows a solution? 

* Q: Copilot not working on qmd files in RStudio.

A: Known [issue](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/15539) for RStudio 2024.12.0+467. Workaround: download and install a newer version of RStudio, e.g., at [Daily Builds](https://dailies.rstudio.com/rstudio/kousa-dogwood/).
