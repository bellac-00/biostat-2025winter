## Today

* Linux basics (cont'd from `awk`).

* Lab 3 (Docker).

## Announcements

* PhysioNet credentialing process may take long. After successful credentialing, you can DM TA or me on Slack so we can add you to a UCLA Box folder where you can download the MIMIC data set. In my experience, downloading from the PhysioNet website is very slow, taking 4-5 hours.
