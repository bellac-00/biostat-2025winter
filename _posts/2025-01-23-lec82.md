## Q&A

* Q: Copilot not working on qmd files in RStudio.

    A: Known [issue](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/15539) for RStudio 2024.12.0+467. Workaround: download and install a newer version of RStudio, e.g., at [Daily Builds](https://dailies.rstudio.com/rstudio/kousa-dogwood/).
    
* Q: Does 80-character limit for code lines apply to text?

    A: No. The 80-character limit is a convention for code readability in scripts and functions. For text, you can have longer lines for better readability.
